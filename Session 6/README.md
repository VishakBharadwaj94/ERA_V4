## Model Evolution

### Baseline (13,808 params)
**Architecture**: Standard CNN with MaxPooling
- 1→16→32→10→16→16→16→16→10 channels
- MaxPool(2,2) for downsampling
- GAP + 1×1 output

**Training**: `lr=0.01, StepLR(step_size=6, gamma=0.1), dropout=0.1`

```
EPOCH 0: Train 86.80% → Test 98.13%
EPOCH 5: Train 98.65% → Test 99.20%
EPOCH 9: Train 98.89% → Test 99.34%
EPOCH 16: Train 99.00% → Test 99.41%
EPOCH 19: Train 99.02% → Test 99.36%

Peak: 99.41% (Epochs 16, 18)
Last 3: 99.37%, 99.41%, 99.36%
```
</details>

**Result**: Establishes baseline. 99.4%+ achievable but parameter budget exceeded.

### Model_1 (7,386 params) - Strided Convolution
**Innovation**: Replace MaxPooling with learnable strided convolution
- Architecture: 1→10→16→10→12→12→16→10
- Key change: `Conv2d(stride=2)` instead of `MaxPool2d(2,2)`
- 46% parameter reduction vs baseline

**Training**: `lr=0.01, StepLR(step_size=6, gamma=0.1), dropout=0.05`

EPOCH 0: Train 88.50% → Test 97.46%
EPOCH 5: Train 98.55% → Test 99.27%
EPOCH 9: Train 98.92% → Test 99.31%
EPOCH 13: Train 98.98% → Test 99.35%
EPOCH 19: Train 99.01% → Test 99.31%

Peak: 99.35% (Epoch 13)
Last 3: 99.34%, 99.29%, 99.31%
```
</details>

**Analysis**: 
- ✓ Strided conv validated as parameter-efficient
- ✓ Under 8k budget with room to spare (614 params)
- ✗ Failed to reach 99.4% - peaked at 99.35%
- Issue: Conservative LR (0.01) + aggressive decay (0.1×) causes plateau at epoch 6

---

### Model_2 (7,849 params) - Strategic Capacity
**Strategy**: Add capacity where receptive field sees complete digits
- Architecture: 1→10→16→10→13→13→16→10
- Changes: convblock4 (12→13), convblock5 (12→13)
- +463 params focused at RF 11-15

**Training**: `lr=0.01, StepLR(step_size=6, gamma=0.1), dropout=0.1`

```
</details>

**Analysis**:
- Strategic capacity increase did NOT solve the problem
- Same performance as different architecture with similar params
- Confirmed: Architecture is not the bottleneck, LR schedule is

### Model_3 (7,849 params) - Higher Learning Rate
**Breakthrough**: 10× higher LR with gentler decay
- Architecture: Same as Model_2
- Key change: `lr=0.1` instead of 0.01
- Gentler schedule: `StepLR(step_size=5, gamma=0.5)`

**Training**: `lr=0.1, StepLR(step_size=5, gamma=0.5), dropout=0.1`

### Final Model (7,849 params) - Optimal Schedule
**Refinement**: More frequent, gentler LR decay for smoothest convergence
- Architecture: Same as Model_2/3
- Optimal schedule: `StepLR(step_size=4, gamma=0.4)`
- More frequent steps (every 4 vs 5 epochs)
- Gentler decay (0.4× vs 0.5×)

## Key Learnings

### 1. Architecture Innovation
**Strided Convolution > MaxPooling**
- Learnable downsampling vs fixed operation
- Same effectiveness, fewer parameters
- Modern approach validated

### 2. Strategic Capacity Allocation
- Focus parameters where receptive field sees complete features
- RF 11-15: Where digit-specific patterns emerge
- Quality of placement > quantity of parameters

### 3. Learning Rate is Critical
Same architecture, different results:
- `lr=0.01` → 99.35% (failed)
- `lr=0.1` → 99.48% (success)

### 4. LR Schedule Optimization
Progressive improvement through iteration:
- `StepLR(6, 0.1)`: Too aggressive, causes plateau
- `StepLR(5, 0.5)`: Good, some volatility
- `StepLR(4, 0.4)`: Optimal, smooth and stable

### 5. Parameter Efficiency
**13,808 → 7,849 params (-43%)**
- Same peak accuracy (99.48%)
- Faster convergence (9 vs 20 epochs)
- Proves modern techniques work

scheduler = StepLR(optimizer, step_size=4, gamma=0.4)

# Train

## Conclusion

Assignment requirements **exceeded**:
- Parameters: 7,849 / 8,000 (98.1% used)
- Accuracy: 99.48% peak, 99.45% last 3 avg
- Speed: First 99.4%+ at epoch 9 (40% under limit)
- Consistency: 91% of final epochs ≥99.4%

**Core insight**: Architecture provides capacity, but hyperparameters unlock it. The combination of strided convolutions (efficiency), strategic capacity allocation (quality), and optimized learning rate schedule (dynamics) achieves production-ready performance with constrained resources.
