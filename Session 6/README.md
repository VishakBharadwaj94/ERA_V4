**Analysis**: 
- ✓ Strided conv works - parameter efficient
- ✗ Failed 99.4% target (peaked 99.31%)
- Issue: LR too low (0.01), aggressive decay (0.1×) freezes learning at epoch 6
- Train (98.94%) < Test (99.31%) = underfitting

---

### Model_3: Strategic Capacity (7,849 params)
**Strategy**: Add capacity where receptive field sees digits (RF 11-15) also increase dropout since there are more parameters

**Architecture**: 
- Channels: 1→10→16→10→**13**→**13**→16→10
- Changed: convblock4 (12→13), convblock5 (12→13)
- +463 params vs Model_2

**Config**: `lr=0.01, StepLR(step_size=6, gamma=0.1), dropout=0.1`

### Model_4: Higher Learning Rate (7,849 params)
**Breakthrough**: 10× higher LR with gentler decay

**Architecture**: Same as Model_3
**Key Change**: `lr=0.1` (vs 0.01), `StepLR(step_size=5, gamma=0.5)` (vs 6, 0.1)

**Config**: `lr=0.1, StepLR(step_size=5, gamma=0.5), dropout=0.1`

**Summary**: Peak 99.48% | Last 3: [99.47%, 99.46%, 99.48%] = 99.47% avg

**Analysis**:
- ✓ SUCCESS - Achieved 99.4%+ consistently
- First hit at epoch 10 (within 15 limit)
- Minor volatility epochs 10-14, stable from 15+
- Same architecture as Model_3, just better LR

---

### Final Model: Optimal Schedule (7,849 params)
**Refinement**: More frequent, gentler LR decay for smoothest convergence

**Architecture**: Same as Model_3/4
**Optimization**: `StepLR(step_size=4, gamma=0.4)` - more frequent, gentler

**Config**: `lr=0.1, StepLR(step_size=4, gamma=0.4), dropout=0.1`

**Analysis**:
- ✓ OPTIMAL - Fastest convergence (epoch 9)
- ✓ Best stability (only 1 dip after first hit)
- ✓ Highest consistency (91% in final stretch)
- More frequent decay (every 4 vs 5) = smoother learning

## Key Insights

### 1. Strided Convolution Works
Replacing MaxPool with stride=2 conv is parameter-efficient and effective. Reduced 13.8k → 7.4k params while maintaining learning capacity.

### 2. Architecture vs Hyperparameters
- Model_2 (7.4k) with lr=0.01 → 99.31% ✗
- Model_3 (7.8k) with lr=0.01 → 99.35% ✗
- Model_4 (7.8k) with lr=0.1 → 99.48% ✓

Same architecture, 10× LR = success

### 3. LR Schedule Matters
- StepLR(6, 0.1): Too aggressive, plateau
- StepLR(5, 0.5): Good, some volatility  
- **StepLR(4, 0.4): Optimal, smooth**

### 4. Parameter Efficiency Proven
**13,808 → 7,849 params (-43%)** while matching 99.48% accuracy and converging faster (9 vs 10 epochs).

import torch.optim as optim
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import StepLR

model = FinalModel().to(device)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1, momentum=0.9)
scheduler = StepLR(optimizer, step_size=4, gamma=0.4)

for epoch in range(20):
    train(model, device, train_loader, optimizer, epoch)
    scheduler.step()
    test(model, device, test_loader)
