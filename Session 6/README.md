**Strategy**: Add capacity where receptive field sees complete digits
- Architecture: 1→10→16→10→13→13→16→10
- Changes: convblock4 (12→13), convblock5 (12→13)
- +463 params focused at RF 11-15

## Key Learnings

### 1. Architecture Innovation
**Strided Convolution > MaxPooling**
- Learnable downsampling vs fixed operation
- Same effectiveness, fewer parameters
- Modern approach validated

### 2. Strategic Capacity Allocation
- Focus parameters where receptive field sees complete features
- RF 11-15: Where digit-specific patterns emerge
- Quality of placement > quantity of parameters

### 3. Learning Rate is Critical
Same architecture, different results:
- `lr=0.01` → 99.35% (failed)
- `lr=0.1` → 99.48% (success)

### 4. LR Schedule Optimization
Progressive improvement through iteration:
- `StepLR(6, 0.1)`: Too aggressive, causes plateau
- `StepLR(5, 0.5)`: Good, some volatility
- `StepLR(4, 0.4)`: Optimal, smooth and stable

### 5. Parameter Efficiency
**13,808 → 7,849 params (-43%)**
- Same peak accuracy (99.48%)
- Faster convergence (9 vs 20 epochs)
- Proves modern techniques work

## Conclusion

Assignment requirements **exceeded**:
- Parameters: 7,849 / 8,000 (98.1% used)
- Accuracy: 99.48% peak, 99.45% last 3 avg
- Speed: First 99.4%+ at epoch 9 (40% under limit)
- Consistency: 91% of final epochs ≥99.4%

**Core insight**: Architecture provides capacity, but hyperparameters unlock it. The combination of strided convolutions (efficiency), strategic capacity allocation (quality), and optimized learning rate schedule (dynamics) achieves production-ready performance with constrained resources.
